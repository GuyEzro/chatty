# This is a sample configuration file for an Azure Static Web App with a React app
# Replace the placeholders with the correct values for your app

# Configuration for the build process
# You can customize the build process by setting the following properties
build:
  # Set the command to build your app
  # This assumes your app has a `package.json` file and uses `npm` as the package manager
  # Change the command if your app uses a different package manager or build tool
  # You can also set additional environment variables here if necessary
  command: npm run build

# Configuration for the app's runtime environment
# You can customize the runtime environment by setting the following properties
# The runtime environment is where your app will be deployed and served to users
# You can configure things like routing, authentication, and security here
# This example assumes you're using React Router for client-side routing
# Replace the placeholders with the correct values for your app
# For more information on configuring the runtime environment, see the Azure Static Web Apps documentation
# (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/configuration)
# Note that this configuration is specific to the React framework
# If you're using a different framework, you'll need to customize the configuration accordingly
# You can also set up environment variables to be used in your app here
# (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/configuration#application-settings)
# The `ROUTER_BASE_PATH` environment variable is used by React Router to set the base path for client-side routing
# Change this value if your app uses a different base path
# The `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable is used to specify the URL for your API
# Change this value if your app uses a different API URL
# Note that environment variables are sensitive information and should not be committed to your repository
# Use Azure Static Web Apps' built-in environment variables to manage sensitive information
# (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/configuration#application-settings)
# You can also use the Azure Key Vault to securely store and manage secrets
# (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/key-vault-secrets)
# See the Azure Static Web Apps documentation for more information

routes:
  # Set up the routes for your app
  # This example assumes you're using React Router for client-side routing
  # Replace the placeholders with the correct values for your app
  # You can add additional routes here if necessary
  # For more information on configuring routing, see the Azure Static Web Apps documentation
  # (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/configuration#routes)
  - route: /api/*
    # Set up the route for your API
    # This example assumes you have an API at `/api`
    # Replace the placeholder with the correct value for your
